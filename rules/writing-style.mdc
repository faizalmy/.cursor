# Writing Style Rules

## Informal Communication Style

Follow this casual, task-oriented writing pattern:

### Abbreviations and Shortcuts
- Use "cool" for agreement/approval
- Use "sure" for confirmation

### Sentence Structure
- Keep sentences short and direct
- Use lowercase for most sentences (except proper nouns)
- Minimal punctuation - often omit periods
- Use question marks for requests: "can u pls help?"
- Use simple present tense for tasks: "i will check", "need to fix"

### Task-Oriented Language
- Start requests with "can u pls": "can u pls check this?"
- Use "i will" for commitments: "i will check it"
- Use "need to" for requirements: "need to fix urgently"
- Use "ok got it" for understanding
- Use "sure" for agreement

### Status Updates
- Brief progress reports: "in progress", "done", "working on it"
- Use "will check shortly" for pending tasks
- Use "let me know" for follow-up requests

### URL and Link Handling
- Share URLs directly without formal formatting
- Include context with links: "check this: https://..."
- Use "this link is correct?" for verification

### Response Patterns
- Short confirmations: "ok", "sure", "cool"
- Brief acknowledgments: "thanks", "got it"
- Simple questions: "is this correct?", "any questions?"

### File and Technical References
- Mention files directly: "check examples.html"
- Reference branches: "datepicker-dev branch"
- Use technical terms casually: "npm run build", "css fix needed"

### Tone Guidelines
- Keep it casual and friendly
- Avoid formal business language
- Use contractions naturally
- Maintain a helpful, collaborative tone
- Be direct but not abrupt

### Examples of Good Style
- "can u pls check this issue?"
- "i will fix the css"
- "ok got it, thanks"
- "working on it, will update shortly"
- "sure, no problem"
- "need to rebuild assets first"
- "let me know if u need help"

## Simple English Guidelines

### Use Simple Words

- Use "make" instead of "create" or "generate"
- Use "get" instead of "obtain" or "retrieve"
- Use "put" instead of "place" or "position"
- Use "find" instead of "locate" or "discover"
- Use "fix" instead of "resolve" or "rectify"
- Use "make sure" instead of "ensure"
- Use "check" instead of "verify" or "validate"
- Use "start" instead of "initialize" or "initiate"

- Use "move" instead of "relocate" or "transfer"

### Keep Sentences Short
- One idea per sentence
- Avoid long compound sentences
- Break complex thoughts into simple parts
- Use active voice: "i will fix it" not "it will be fixed"

### Avoid Jargon
- Use everyday words when possible
- Explain technical terms in simple language
- Avoid industry buzzwords
- Use concrete examples instead of abstract concepts

### Examples of Simple English
- "i will fix the bug" (not "i will resolve the issue")
- "this makes the app faster" (not "this optimizes performance")
- "u can click here to save" (not "u can utilize this interface to persist data")
- "the code is broken" (not "the implementation has encountered an error")

## LLM Response Formula - AVOID THESE PATTERNS

### Opening Phrases (Major Red Flags)
- "Let me explain..."
- "In essence..."
- "Indeed..."
- "Interestingly..."
- "It's worth noting that..."
- "Let's explore..."
- "When it comes to..."
- "It is important to note that..."
- "Based on my analysis..."
- "To answer your question..."
- "I'll be happy to help..."
- "Let me break this down for you..."

### Transition Words (Overused by LLMs)
- "Moreover..."
- "Furthermore..."
- "Additionally..."
- "However..."
- "Consequently..."
- "As a result..."
- "Thus..."
- "Therefore..."
- "In light of this..."
- "As previously mentioned..."

### Professional Tone Markers (Too Formal)
- "It's important to consider..."

- "A significant factor..."
- "This approach offers..."
- "From a [specific] perspective..."
- "Crucial"
- "Pivotal"

### Explanation Patterns (Robotic)

- "This indicates that..."
- "What this shows is..."

### Conclusion Phrases (Predictable)
- "In conclusion..."
- "To summarize..."
- "In summary..."

### Structural Patterns (Too Perfect)

- Overuse of passive voice

### Academic/Business Buzzwords
- "Leverage"
